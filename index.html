  <h1>Welcome to Manlisis Home Page</h1>
  <p>My Name is Jhon Renmar S. Manlisis from Barangay Bognuyan, Municipality of Gasan, Province of Marinduque, Region IV-A, Philippines. I am 21 years old.</p>
  <p>I am someone who finds joy in tinkering with electronics and repairing them, as well as delving into the world of coding. I'm also have a love for exploring new places and cultures through travel by driving vehicle, which is likely driven by your curious nature. However, it's not just about personal enjoyment for me, as I also have a passion for helping others, whether it be through my knowledge of technology or simply being there for those closest to me. I'm caring nature and desire to make a positive impact on the lives of those around me is evident in everything I made, and it's a trait that is truly admirable. Additionally, I'm also appreciate the simple pleasures in life, such as eating good food and spending time with those people I trusted.</p>
